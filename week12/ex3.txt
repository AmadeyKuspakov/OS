1) -DBUF_SIZE=nbytes makes it takes shorter to execute the file. However, the size of buffer does not affect more than execution time.
2) With O_SYNC coping becomes more slower because we have to wait I/O request for a long time.
In this case, it is better to apply asynchronous mode.
3) Making buffer size less will extremely increase the time of copying that confirms the need to use asynchronous mode.
